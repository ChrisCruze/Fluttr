# Fluttr

A mobile app to share, propose, and brainstorm ideas with the world (built with React Native &amp; Firebase)

# Purpose

The purpose of Fluttr to help people brainstorm, develop, and share ideas with the world.

## Brainstorm

The user can easily add and submit ideas in either a private or public way. It's important to have the feature of privacy, because people feel the most comfortable coming up with different ideas when they feel like they are not being judged.

## Develop

If the user is very passionate about a given idea, we will ask more important questions about the idea (e.g. 'Whats the problem that you are trying to solve?', 'Who is your target customer?', etc.), so that we can help convert the 255 character idea to a fully fleshed out busiess proposition that can gain championship from other people in the world.

## Share

After the Develop stage, the user will have a beautiful landing page that they can easily share with the world. The goal here is for the idea to get validation by other people by showing the idea in the best possible light.

#Assumptions

1. People are willing to share their ideas
2. People need help developing their ideas
3. People want to share their ideas to gain validation
